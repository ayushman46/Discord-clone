# üß™ Local Testing Guide

Your Discord Clone is now running locally! Here's how to test all the features before deployment.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites Verified
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database created and running
- ‚úÖ Backend server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- ‚úÖ Frontend development server running on `http://localhost:5173`

## üöÄ Testing Flow

### 1. **Register a New User**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Click "Sign Up" if you see the auth page
   - Fill in username, email, and password
   - Click "Register"
   - Expected: You're redirected to the main app or login page

### 2. **Login with Your Credentials**
   - If not automatically logged in, login with your credentials
   - Expected: You see the main chat interface with an empty server list

### 3. **Create a Server**
   - Look for a "Create Server" button or input field
   - Enter a server name (e.g., "My Test Server")
   - Click "Create"
   - Expected: Server appears in the left sidebar

### 4. **Create a Channel**
   - Select the server you just created
   - Look for "Create Channel" button
   - Enter a channel name (e.g., "general")
   - Click "Create"
   - Expected: Channel appears in the channel list

### 5. **Send a Message**
   - Click on the channel you created
   - Type a message in the message input box
   - Click "Send" or press Enter
   - Expected: Message appears in the chat with timestamp, sender name, and your avatar

### 6. **Test Real-time Messaging**
   - Open the app in another browser tab or window (same or different login)
   - Send a message from tab 1
   - Expected: Message appears instantly in tab 2 without refresh

### 7. **Test Typing Indicator**
   - Start typing in the message input
   - Expected: See "User is typing..." indicator in chat (or similar)
   - Stop typing for 3 seconds
   - Expected: Typing indicator disappears

### 8. **Test File Upload**
   - Click the file/attachment icon in the message input area
   - Select a file from your computer
   - Expected: File is uploaded and appears as a link in the message

### 9. **Test User Presence**
   - Send a message in one tab
   - Open another browser tab/window and login
   - Expected: See notifications like "User joined" in the chat

### 10. **Test the FAQ Bot**
   - Look for a "Bot" or "FAQ" input field
   - Ask a question like "What is React?" or "How do I use WebSockets?"
   - Expected: Bot returns a relevant FAQ answer from the knowledge base

## üîç API Testing (Advanced)

### Test Endpoints with Swagger UI
Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

Key endpoints to test:
- **POST /auth/register** - Create a new user
- **POST /auth/login** - Login and get JWT token
- **GET /servers** - List your servers
- **POST /servers** - Create new server
- **GET /servers/{server_id}/channels** - List channels in server
- **POST /servers/{server_id}/channels** - Create new channel
- **GET /channels/{channel_id}/messages** - Get message history
- **POST /channels/{channel_id}/messages** - Send message
- **POST /upload** - Upload a file
- **POST /ask-bot** - Query the FAQ bot

### WebSocket Testing
Connect to: `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws?token=YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`

Send messages with this format:
```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "channel_id": 1,
  "content": "Hello, World!"
}
```

Or typing indicator:
```json
{
  "type": "typing",
  "channel_id": 1
}
```

## üìä Expected Performance
- Messages should appear in <100ms
- File uploads should complete within 2-5 seconds
- Bot responses within 1-2 seconds
- No console errors in browser DevTools

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is in use
lsof -i :8000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart:
cd /Users/ayush/Downloads/Discord-clone/backend
PYTHONPATH=/Users/ayush/Downloads/Discord-clone/backend \
/Users/ayush/Downloads/Discord-clone/backend/venv/bin/python3 \
-m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Issue: Frontend won't load
```bash
# Check if port 5173 is in use
lsof -i :5173

# Restart:
cd /Users/ayush/Downloads/Discord-clone/frontend
npx vite
```

### Issue: WebSocket connection fails
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try in an incognito/private window

### Issue: Database errors
- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `brew services list`
- Check .env file has correct DATABASE_URL
- Try recreating tables: `python3 setup_db.py` in backend directory
